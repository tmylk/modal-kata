# modal-kata

A tutorial on Test Driven Development in the cloud with modal. The cloud push and test is under 10 seconds, so testing and debugging orchestration issues is a treat.  Conclusion: Yes it is fast, but you might still want to have a local dev env for even smoother experience.

Use [modal](https://modal.com/) and `duckdb` to plot daily taxi rides in NYC Taxi dataset. 

Running a script in modal generates a plot off this 267 Gb dataset in just 10-20 seconds, streaming the data.

See `tasklist.md` for a walk-through of the steps.
